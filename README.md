# SAiDL-Summer-Assignment-2019

For Task 1 despite several attempts, I've not been able to make it work. I've pasted an earlier attempt too under the name NumpyNeuralNetwork_ObjectOriented.ipynb . In none of my attempts was my neural network learning so I wasn't really sure what to do so I've left it as is. The cause might be that my weights and biases are all getting changed such that it moves my all predictions for the binary digits towards 0.5.

The submission is __NumpyNeuralNetwork_FinalTask1.ipynb__

For Task 2, I've provided task2.md to help understand the code faster. I've not been able to implement anything more complex. 

The submission is __ComputerVision.ipynb__

For Task 3, I've read "A Latent Recurrent Model for Sequential Data". Through this, I've been able to learn a lot more than I thought I would've been able to handle. It was very helpful for me to explore other areas of Machine Learning I was previously oblivious to.

The submission is __review1.pdf__

Finally, I'd thank you guys for the experience. I've learnt more useful and interesting things in the past 3 weeks than probably in my whole first year. I know I wasn't able to complete the assignment by the deadline but I'll finish it regardless.
